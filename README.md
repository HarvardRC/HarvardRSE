# Research Software Engineering Community at Harvard

Welcome to Github Repository of Research Software Engineering Community at Harvard,

We at [FASRC](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/research-software-engineering-rse/) have launched the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Community at Harvard, and we would love to have you in this community. The RSE community seeks to establish a vibrant community of developers and researchers who share skills, standard code, and ideas, hold bi-annual workshops, and learn about RSE opportunities at Harvard. Our vision in the near future is to expand our community to New England and foster a wider collaborative environment across the whole region and being part of the national and international efforts on RSE activities in the US Research Software Engineering Association ([US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)) and The Society of Research Software Engineering [RSE](https://society-rse.org/), respectively.

We are planning our first Harvard RSE workshop for 2021, and we hope to see you there. We'll send the announcement for the first event to the community mailing list.
