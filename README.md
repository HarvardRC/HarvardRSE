# Research Software Engineering Community at Harvard

The Harvard Research Computing team is excited to announce the launch of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Community at Harvard. We invite you to join us in this community, where developers and researchers can share their skills, code, and ideas. We host bi-annual workshops, provide information about RSE opportunities at Harvard, and are working towards expanding our community to New England. Our ultimate goal is to foster a collaborative environment throughout the entire region and to contribute to the national and international efforts of the US Research Software Engineering Association ([US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)) and The Society of Research Software Engineering [RSE](https://society-rse.org/).

Our inaugural Harvard RSE workshop is scheduled for 2023, and we would be thrilled to see you there! Keep an eye on the community mailing list for updates and announcements regarding the event.
